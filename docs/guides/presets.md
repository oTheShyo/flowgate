# Presets 2.0 Guide

One-line agent initialization with production-ready defaults.

---

## 🎯 Overview

Presets 2.0 reduces agent setup from 20+ lines of manual configuration to just **one line of code**. Choose from 5 production-ready presets optimized for different use cases.

### The Simplest Possible Setup:

```python
from flowgate import get_balanced_agent

agent = get_balanced_agent()  # That's it!
```

**Result**: Automatic provider detection, production-ready model cascade, 80-90% cost savings vs GPT-4.

---

## 🚀 Why Presets 2.0?

### Before v0.2.0 (Manual Configuration):

```python
from flowgate import CascadeAgent, ModelConfig

# 28 lines of manual configuration
models = [
    ModelConfig(
        name="llama-3.1-8b-instant",
        provider="groq",
        cost=0.00005,
        quality_tier=1,
    ),
    ModelConfig(
        name="gpt-4o-mini",
        provider="openai",
        cost=0.00015,
        quality_tier=2,
    ),
    ModelConfig(
        name="gpt-4o",
        provider="openai",
        cost=0.005,
        quality_tier=3,
    ),
]

agent = CascadeAgent(
    models=models,
    validation_threshold=0.7,
    max_attempts=3
)
```

**Problems:**
- 28 lines of boilerplate

agent = get_balanced_agent()
```

**Benefits:**
- 1 line of code (96% reduction)
- Automatic provider detection
- Production-ready defaults
- Optimized model cascade

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Custom Configuration with Presets:

You can still customize preset behavior:

```python
from flowgate import get_balanced_agent

# Start with preset
agent = get_balanced_agent()

# Override specific settings if needed
agent.validation_threshold = 0.8  # Higher quality bar
agent.max_attempts = 5  # More retries
agent.enable_cache = True  # Enable caching
```

### Mixing Presets with Manual Configuration:

For advanced use cases, you can still use manual configuration:

```python
from flowgate import CascadeAgent, ModelConfig

# Full manual control
models = [
    ModelConfig(name="custom-model", provider="custom", cost=0.001),
]

agent = CascadeAgent(models=models)
```

**Note:** Manual configuration is still fully supported but shows deprecation hints suggesting Presets 2.0.

---

## 🌍 Automatic Provider Detection

Presets 2.0 **automatically detect** which providers are available based on your environment variables:

```bash
# .env file
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
TOGETHER_API_KEY=...
```

```python
from flowgate import get_balanced_agent

# Automatically uses all available providers!
agent = get_balanced_agent()
```

**Supported providers:**
- ✅ OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, o1)
- ✅ Groq (Llama 3.1, Mixtral)
- ✅ Anthropic (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
- ✅ Together AI (open-source models)

**What if I don't have all API keys?**

No problem! Presets adapt to available providers:

- **Only OpenAI?** → Uses GPT-4o-mini → GPT-4o cascade
- **Only Groq?** → Uses Llama models
- **Multiple providers?** → Uses optimized multi-provider cascade

**No configuration needed** - it just works!

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No providers detected"

**Problem:** Presets can't find any API keys.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check environment variables
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY
echo $GROQ_API_KEY

# Or create .env file:
cat > .env << EOF
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...
EOF
```

---

### Issue: "Quality too low for my use case"

**Problem:** Default preset quality doesn't meet requirements.

**Solution:**
```python
# Option 1: Use quality-optimized preset
from flowgate import get_quality_optimized_agent

agent = get_quality_optimized_agent()

# Option 2: Adjust validation threshold
from flowgate import get_balanced_agent

agent = get_balanced_agent()
agent.validation_threshold = 0.85  # Higher quality bar
```

---

### Issue: "Responses too slow"

**Problem:** Latency is higher than expected.

**Solution:**
```python
# Option 1: Use speed-optimized preset
from flowgate import get_speed_optimized_agent

agent = get_speed_optimized_agent()  # <800ms validated

# Option 2: Ensure Groq API key is set (fastest provider)
# GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_... in .env
```

---

### Issue: "Costs higher than expected"

**Problem:** Queries cost more than benchmarks suggest.

**Solution:**
```python
# Option 1: Use cost-optimized preset
from flowgate import get_cost_optimized_agent

agent = get_cost_optimized_agent()

# Option 2: Check if expensive models are being used
result = await agent.run("query")
print(f"Model used: {result.model_used}")  # See which model answered
print(f"Cost: ${result.total_cost:.6f}")
```

---

## 🎓 Best Practices

### 1. Start with Balanced

```python
from flowgate import get_balanced_agent

agent = get_balanced_agent()  # Best starting point
```

### 2. Use Development for Testing

```python
from flowgate import get_development_agent

# In tests
agent = get_development_agent()  # Fast, verbose, cheap
```

### 3. Optimize Based on Metrics

```python
# Track metrics
results = []
for query in queries:
    result = await agent.run(query)
    results.append({
        "cost": result.total_cost,
        "quality": result.quality_score,
        "latency": result.latency
    })

# Analyze and switch presets if needed
avg_cost = sum(r["cost"] for r in results) / len(results)
if avg_cost > threshold:
    agent = get_cost_optimized_agent()
```

### 4. Use Auto Agent for Multi-Tenant

```python
from flowgate import auto_agent

def get_agent_for_tier(tier):
    presets = {
        "free": "cost_optimized",
        "pro": "balanced",
        "enterprise": "quality_optimized"
    }
    return auto_agent(presets[tier])
```
